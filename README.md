# iBuild add-on for Arma 3
Modular base building add-on for [Bohemia Interactive's](https://www.bistudio.com) [ArmA 3](https://www.bistudio.com/games/arma3)

## The Situation
Due to time constraints, personal life matters, and general frustrations with the Arma engine. I've decided to release the iBuild source code to the Arma community so somebody can continue my work. But please do read and adhere to the license contained within this repository before you consider using it.

## License
All code and assets are released under the Arma [(APL-SA)](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike) license.
